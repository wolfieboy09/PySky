# IMPORTANT
PySky is NOT fully completed!

# Welcome to PySky!
Pysky is a Hypixel Skyblock (HS) player status viewer.\
PySky is a project that started with Wolfie (@Wolfieboy09)
This is the largest project Ive done so far

# How did PySky get its name?
> PySky are two words together. "Python," and "Skyblock."\
> I know that PySky is another thing for weather API and what not
> 
# How to use
When you run "main.py", you have to enter a users Minecraft username, then the profile name.\
If a profile name, user does not play HS, or user does not exist, there are systems in place to tell you the issue.

# PySky's API
The API that PySky currently uses is [SkyCrypt](https://sky.shiiyu.moe/api).\
PySky may create its own API for Python users. (will take time too)


# Files
main.py - The main file \
color.py - Text color and stylest\
dungeons.py - Players dungeons status\
getData.py - Gets data from the API\
tailsmen.py - Gets the players Tailsmen(s)\
userCheck.py - Checks player and profile name given.\
README.md - its this file that your reading.\
errorLog.py - Logs errors in the "errors" dirictory in a .txt file\
imp - Holdes all the files in one to stay more organized.
